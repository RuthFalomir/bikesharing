# bikesharing

A wonderfull 2-week long trip around New York City inspired this project. We spent the time traveling around, visiting important landmarks all over the city. Our most important tool was our bike, provided by the company Citybike. Moving around in bicycles allowed us to really get to know the city and to interact with people who live there. This whole endevour inspired us to recreate Citybike in our home town: De Moins, Iowa.

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to obtain seed funding from our possible Angel Investor to explore a bike-sharing program in our home town. First of all, we need to understand how, when, and why this bike-sharing program works in NY. From there, we went on to create a proposal for our investor.  

## Results: 
We analyzed the data and worked on several visualizations using Tableau. We will be describing our findings shortly.

### Tourist Map

This map shows us the amount of bikes being used in the city. Clearly, the area with higher density is a were tourists commonly visit more. Taking that into consideration, it is expected that bikes will be used more intensely in tourist-friendly locations. We will work on defining this same areas in Des Moins. 

### Bike Checkout Times

In this image, we can see the amount of bikes checked out and for how long they were used. As we can see here, users normally rent the bikes between 5-40 minutes. 

### Bike Checkout Times by Gender

However, a deeper analysis of the previous data shows that male and female users do not share the same bike-renting habits. Female users rent about 1/3 of the bikes that male users rent. Another important insight is that male users tend to use the bikes for a longer period of time. We should take this into consideration when creating marketing campaigns in Des Moins. Perhaps we should focus more on the male market that the female one. Even more interesting, though, would be to find out how to make bike-sharing more enjoyable/useful for female users. 

### Trips by Weekday

As we can see here, Thursday afternoons are the busiest time for Bikeshare. However, Monday to Friday, from 7am to 9am and from 4pm to 7pm, they experience heavy user traffic. Saturdays and Sundays tend to get busy around noon. 

### Trips by Weekday by Gender
<img width="445" alt="Trips by gender 4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88563922/146652624-6b313388-8370-4217-bcd9-153d60e4ea17.PNG">

This image confirms what the last two graphs showed. In general, males and females tend to use bikes around the same time of the day and the week. However, we can clearly see the difference between the usage, since the male side of the map is much darker that the female side. 

### Trips by User Type
<img width="440" alt="user trips by weekday by hour 5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88563922/146652668-24254917-1265-462b-ae74-4d16b4d6ff1e.PNG">

This image is an interesting one. There are two types of users for Bikeshare. First, the subscribers, and second, the customers. Customers are one-timers, while subscribers pay a fee that allows them to use the bikes whenever they want. This insight is important since it shows, very clearly, that subscribers are the ones using the bikes much more often than one-time users. Subscribers are possibly using bikes, not as tourists, but as tools for commutes around the city. Specially male subscribers. 

### Birth dates vs Ride Duration
<img width="521" alt="birth dates 6" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88563922/146652769-00d0c96d-eb1e-4272-8aee-131e6f40fa3e.PNG">

One last insight appeared when we looked into the riders' birth dates to see how they affected the amount of time spent on that specific bike ride. As we can see, as birth dates get higher, bike rides rise too. Of course, there are expections to this rule, but in general, older costumers have a less stable behavior than younger ones. 


## Summary: 
In general, we obtained very informative insights about Bikeshare's clientele. If we could put all that we learned about the clients in a sentence, it would be: Male subscribers from Monday to Friday, during noon and the afternoon, make up the most demand for bikes in NY. However, it would be fun and important to understand how to involve female users more. Perhaps, a deeper understanding on what bikes are being used for could give us a hint as to why there is such a big difference in gender usage. We could also interview users to understand how safe they feel when bike-riding throughout the city, and how Bikeshare (or a new Des Moins bike-sharing company) could help its users feel safer.
